# Overview

 Movie search app that I made mostly for fun and to keep my react skills from going rusty.
 When a user searches for a movie, it fires a call to the Movie Database api and the results are fetched and displayed. 
 One of the main things that I wanted to get better at was improving user experience and aesthetics for a web page layout, which is something that I tried to do in this project. 

## How to run
Clone the repo and run `npm install` to install all necessary dependancies. Then run `npm run` to run the app.
